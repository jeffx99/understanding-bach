One of the most basic organizational units of music, to continue the (loose) grammatical analogy, is the \textbf{phrase}, which we define as a unit possessing a certain level of structural \say{completeness}. Each phrase must be delimited in some way, so that the listener may easily distinguish between them; this can be likened to how the comma or the period functions to delineate clauses in written language. Generally, one observes certain harmonic formulae and melodic tendencies at these musical \say{commas}, referred to as \textbf{cadences}. We therefore shall start with a brief review of common cadential patterns(see Chapter ?? for a more detailed study).
